\section{Introduction}

This paper investigates the solution of discrete time  dynamic stochastic
infinite-horizon economies with bounded-time-invariant solutions.
It describes how to obtain decision rules satisfying a system of 
first-order conditions, ``Euler Equations'',  and how to assess their accuracy.\footnote{This series 
representation should also prove useful for applications based on
value function iteration but I  defer treating this topic for
 future work.
}
 For an overview of techniques for solving nonlinear models,
see \citep{judd92,Christiano2000,doraszelskiy04,gaspar97,Judd2014,marcet.lorenzoni99,juddGSSA2011,maliarmovingbounds,RePEc:bny:wpaper:0058}.


This new series representation for bounded time series, adapted from \citep{anderson10},
\begin{gather*}
      	 x\tArg =B x_{t-1}+ \phi \psi_\epsilon\epsilon + (I - F)^{-1} \phi \psi_c + \sum_{\sForSum=0}^\infty F^\sForSum \phi \ZWOarg_{t+\nu}\tArg%\\ \intertext{ so that}
%\expct{ x_{t+1}\tArg} =B x\tArg  + (I - F)^{-1} \phi \psi_c+ \sum_{\sForSum =1}^\infty F^{\sForSum-1} \phi \ZWOarg_{t+\nu}\tArg.
    \end{gather*}
 makes it possible to  construct a series
    representation for any bounded time invariant discrete time map.\footnote{As yet, the author has found no comparable use of a
linear reference dynamical system for  conveniently transforming
one bounded infinite dimensional series into another.
}
    % and its conditional expectation function:
    It turns out that this representation provides a way to use
    Euler equation errors to
    approximate the magnitude of the    approximation error in components of 
    decision rules.
    Others have also studied approximation error for dynamic stochastic models\cite{judd2017lower,santos2005accuracy,Santos2000accuracy}. This paper provides a more precise approximation
    explicitly relating the magnitude of components of the
    Euler equation errors to the magnitude of components of
    errors in the decision rule 
without resort to statistical inference or ancillary simulations.

    In addition, the series representation provides exploitable
    constraints on model solutions that enhance  
    algorithm reliability and improve solution accuracy.
    The series representation readily accommodates models with
    multiple ergodic sets
    thereby providing a robust solution method for a wide class of models including models with occasionally binding constraints and/or regime switching.\marginpar{More information about other error formulae.}

%    $\ZWOarg_{t+\nu}$ that satisfy the model equations thereby

The numerical implementation of the algorithm 
builds upon the work of
\citep{juddGSSA2011}.
In particular it uses
the an-isotropic Smolyak Method, the adaptive
parallelotope method\citep{Judd2014}
and precomputes all integrals required for the conditional expectations.
The algorithm should scale well to large models as many 
of the algorithm's components can be computed in parallel.











The paper is organized as follows.
Section \ref{sec:newseries} presents a useful new series representation for any bounded time series.
Section \ref{sec:extToMaps} shows how to apply this series representation to time invariant maps.
Section \ref{sec:solnerrorbounds} provides formulae for approximating dynamic stochastic model error in proposed  solutions.
Section \ref{sec:algoforsoln} presents a new solution algorithm for improving proposed solutions.
%Section \ref{sec:future} discusses directions for future work.
Section \ref{sec:conc} concludes.\marginpar{Section 6?}

\section{A New Series Representation For  Bounded Time Series}
\label{sec:newseries}
Since \cite{blanchard80} numerous authors have developed solution algorithms and formulae for solving linear rational expectations models.  It turns out that
the solutions associated with these linear 
saddle point models, by quantifying the potential 
impact of anticipated future shocks,
 can play a new and somewhat surprising role 
in characterizing the 
solutions for highly nonlinear models. 
This section describes the relationship 
between linear reference models and general bounded time series in route to
discussing how these calculations can be useful for representing time invariant maps.
\subsection{Linear Reference Models and a Formula for  ``Anticipated Shocks''}
\label{sec:linref}




For any linear homogeneous 
$L$ dimensional deterministic system that produces  a unique stable solution, \marginpar{separate applied math paper?}
\begin{gather*}
  	 H_{-1} x_{t-1} + H_0 x_t + H_1 x_{t+1}=0
\end{gather*}
inhomogeneous solutions 
\begin{gather}
	 H_{-1} x_{t-1} + H_0 x_t + H_1 x_{t+1}=\psi_\epsilon \epsilon +\psi_{c}
\intertext{ can be computed as}
x_t=B x_{t-1} + \phi \psi_\epsilon \epsilon + (I - F)^{-1} \phi \psi_c\label{hSystem}
\intertext{where}
\phi= (H_0 +H_1 B)^{-1}  \text{ and } \,\,F=-\phi H_1.\citep{anderson10}
\end{gather}
It will be useful to collect the components of this solution for use later in the paper. I will use these matrices  to construct a series representation for any bounded path.
Define $\linMod \equiv \linModMats$.

\begin{theorem}
Consider any bounded discrete time path
 \begin{gather}
   \xWOarg_t \in{R^L}\,\text{ with }\,\infNorm{\xWOarg_t}  \le \overline{\mathcal{X}}\,\,\,\,\,\forall t> 0 \label{aBPath}.
 \end{gather}
Now, given the trajectories \refeq{aBPath}, define 
$  \zWOarg_{t}$ as  
\begin{gather}
  \zWOarg_{t} \equiv H_{-1} \xWOarg_{t-1} +  H_0 \xWOarg_{t} +  H_1 \xWOarg_{t+1} -\psi_c - \psi_\epsilon \epsilon_t \label{defZ} 
\end{gather}
One can then express the $\xWOarg_t$ solving 
\begin{gather}
	 H_{-1} x_{t-1} + H_0 x_t + H_1 x_{t+1}=\psi_\epsilon \epsilon +\psi_{c}+
z_t
\intertext{ using}
	 \xWOarg_{t} =B x_{t-1}+ \phi \psi_\epsilon\epsilon + (I - F)^{-1} \phi \psi_c + \sum_{\sForSum=0}^\infty F^s \phi \zWOarg_{t+\sForSum} \label{theSeries}
\intertext{and}
	 \xWOarg_{t+k+1} =B \xWOarg_{t+k}  + (I - F)^{-1} \phi \psi_c+ \sum_{\sForSum =0}^\infty F^\sForSum \phi \zWOarg_{t+k+\sForSum+1} \,\,\,\,\,\forall t,k \ge  0.
	 \end{gather}
\end{theorem}
%\end{tcolorbox}



\begin{myProof}
See \citep{anderson10},
\end{myProof}

	 Consequently, given a bounded time series \refeq{aBPath},
and a stable linear homogeneous system like \refeq{hSystem},
one can easily compute a corresponding series representation like
\refeq{theSeries} for $x_t$.
Interestingly, the linear model, $H$, the  constant term $\psi_c$ and the
impact of the stochastic shocks $\psi_\epsilon $ can  be 
chosen rather arbitrarily -- the only constraints being the existence of a saddle-point solution for the linear system and that z-values fall in the row space of $H_1$.  
%The formula will provide a series  for any $L$ dimensional $\linMod$.



% \footnote{$\psi_c$ full rank provides a sufficient condition, but not necessary condition.}
The
transformation $ {\{ x_{t}, x_{t}, x_{t+1},x_{t+2}\ldots\}} \rightarrow \linMod(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t) \rightarrow{\{ z_{t}, z_{t+1}, z_{t+2},\ldots\}} $ is invertible. $ {\{ z_{t}, z_{t+1}, z_{t+2},\ldots\}} \rightarrow \linMod(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t)^{-1} \rightarrow{\{ x_{t}, x_{t}, x_{t+1},x_{t+2}\ldots\}} $ and the inverse can be interpreted as giving the impact of ``fully anticipated future shocks'' on the path of $x_t$  in a linear perfect foresight model.  
Note that the reference model is deterministic.  
Further, note that since the eigenvalues of $F$ are all less than one in magnitude, the formula supports the intuition that far distant shocks
 influence current conditions less than  imminent shocks.
In what follows,
 the $z_t\tArg$ functions will 
fully account for any stochastic aspects encountered in the models I  analyze.

A key feature to note is that the series representation can accommodate arbitrarily complex time series trajectories, so long as these trajectories are bounded.
Later, this observation will give us some confidence in the 
robustness of the algorithms described in section 
\ref{sec:unknown-solutions} for constructing series 
representations for unknown families of functions 
satisfying complicated systems of dynamic non-linear equations.

\subsection{Arbitrary  Bounded Time Series and an ``Almost'' Arbitrary Linear Model }
\label{sec:almostarbitrary}


Consider the following matrix constructed from ``almost'' arbitrary coefficients
\begin{gather}
  \begin{bmatrix}
H_{-1}&H_{0}&H_{1} \label{linRef}
  \end{bmatrix}=
\vcenter{\hbox{\includegraphics{refHmat.pdf}}}\intertext{with $\psi_c=\psi_\epsilon=0, \,\,  \psi_z=I$.
These coefficients are not completely arbitrary.  They have been chosen so that 
the linear model has a unique stable solution and, since $H_1$ is full rank,
its column space will span the rows where I will encounter non zero values for $z_t$. 
This flexibility will 
become more important in the context below where I must 
choose a  linear reference model in a context where I may have 
little guidance about what might make a good linear reference model.  It turns out that the algorithm is very forgiving about the choice of $\linMod$.  The solution for this system is
}
  B=
\vcenter{\hbox{\includegraphics{refBmat.pdf}}}\\
\phi=
\vcenter{\hbox{\includegraphics{refPhimat.pdf}}}\\
F=
\vcenter{\hbox{\includegraphics{refFmat.pdf}}}
\end{gather} 



It is straightforward to apply \ref{theSeries} to  the following three
bounded families of time series paths 
\begin{gather}
  x_{1,t}=\frac{\someNorm{x_{t-1}}}{{1+\someNorm{\epsilon_{t}}}} D_\pi(t) \intertext{where $D_\pi(t)$ gives the t-th digit of $\pi$}
x_{2,t}=\frac{\someNorm{x_{t-1}}}{({1+\someNorm{\epsilon_{t}}})^2} (-1)^t\\
ax_{3,t}=\epsilon_t \intertext{and the $\epsilon_t$ are a sequence of pseudo random draws from the uniform distributions $\mathcal{U}(-4,4)$ produced subsequent to the selection of a random seed.} randomseed(\someNorm{x_{t-1}}+\someNorm{\epsilon_t})
\end{gather} 
The upper three panels in Figure \ref{arbpaths} display these three time series. The first set of trajectories characterizes 
a function of the digits in the decimal representation of $\pi$ and was chosen
to emphasize that continuity is not important for the existence of the series. 
The second set of trajectories  oscillates between two values
determined by  a nonlinear function of the initial conditions, $x_{t-1}$ and the shock.
The third set of trajectories characterizes a sequence of uniformly distributed random numbers based on a seed determined by  a nonlinear function of  the initial conditions and the shock.
These paths were chosen to emphasize that the trajectories
 need not converge to a fixed point, and 
need not be produced by some linear rational expectations solution or by the
 iteration of a discrete-time map.
The spanning condition and the boundedness of the paths are  sufficient conditions for the existence 
of the series representation based on the ``almost arbitrary'' 
linear reference model,$\linMod$.\footnote{Although potentially useful in some contexts,
this paper will not investigate representations for families of
unbounded, but slowly diverging  trajectories.}


\begin{figure}
  \centering
\includegraphics[width=2in]{piPath.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=2in]{oscillPath.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=2in]{pseudoPath.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=3in]{theZs.pdf}  
  
  \caption{Arbitrary Bounded Time Series Paths and Corresponding $z_{i,t}$ values}\label{arbpaths}
\end{figure}





Figure \ref{arbpaths} also shows, for a particular initial state vector and shock value,  the paths for the  fully anticipated z's that generate the corresponding $x_t$ path.
One can repeat the calculations for any given initial condition to produce
a z series exactly replicating the new set of trajectories.  Thus, the family
of z functions along with equation \ref{theSeries} provide a series 
representation for the entire family of trajectories. Numerical linear algebra calculations can easily transform a $z_t$ series into an $x_t$ series and vice versa.  This can be done for any path starting from particular initial conditions.  In this way one can see that any discrete time invariant map that generates families of bounded paths has a series representation like Equation \ref{theSeries}.





\subsection{Assessing $x_t$ Errors}
\label{sec:truncationerr}
The formula \ref{theSeries} was derived in \citep{anderson10}
to compute the impact on the current state of fully anticipated future shocks.  The formula characterizes the impact exactly.  However one can contemplate the impact of at least two deviations from the exact calculation:
\begin{enumerate}
\item One could truncate a series of correct values of $z_t$.  
\item One might have imprecise values of $z_t$ along the path.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Truncation Error}


The series representation can compute the entire series to machine precision
if all the terms are included, but, it will be useful to notice that
the terms for state vectors closer 
to the initial time have the most important impact.
One could consider approximating  $\mathcal{X}_t$ by 
truncating the series \ref{theSeries} at a finite number of terms.
 	 \begin{gather}
 	 \xWOargK_t \equiv B x_{t-1}+ \phi \psi_\epsilon\epsilon  + (I - F)^{-1} \phi \psi_c + \sum_{s=0}^k F^s \phi z_{t}\label{theTruncSeries}
 \end{gather}
I can bound the  series approximation truncation errors.
Since
    \begin{gather}
      \label{eq:1}
\sum_{s=k+1}^{\infty} F^s \phi \psi_z = (I -F)^{-1} F^{k+1}\phi \psi_z       \\
\infNorm{\xWarg-\xWargK} \le \infNorm{(I -F)^{-1} F^{k+1}\phi \psi_z} \left ( \infNorm{H_{-1} }+ \infNorm{H_{0} }+ \infNorm{H_{1} } \right )\overline{\mathcal{X}}
    \end{gather}
Again, note that for approximating $\xWarg$ the impact of  a given realization along the path declines for those realizations which are  more temporally distant.

 Figure \ref{figArbTrunc} shows
that this truncation error can be  a very conservative measure of the accuracy
of the truncated series.  The orange line represents the computed approximation of
the infinity norm of the difference between $x_t$ from the full series and a truncated series for different lengths of the truncation.  The blue line shows the infinity norm of the actual difference between the $x_t$ computed using the full series and the value obtained using a truncated series.  The series requires only the first 20 terms to compute
the initial value of the state vector to high precision. 


\begin{figure}
  \centering


\includegraphics[width=3in]{arbTruncErr.pdf}  
  \caption{$x_t$ Error Approximation Versus Actual Error} \label{figArbTrunc}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Path Error}


We can assess the impact of perturbed values for $z_t$ by computing the maximum discrepancy required for the $z_t$ and applying the 
partial sum formula
Thus, one can  approximate $\mathcal{X}_t$ using
 	 \begin{gather}
 	 \xWOargK_t \equiv B x_{t-1}+ \phi \psi_\epsilon\epsilon  + (I - F)^{-1} \phi \psi_c + \sum_{s=0}^\infty F^s \phi (z_{t}+\Delta z_{t})\label{theDeltaSeries}
 \end{gather}
Note yet again that for approximating $\xWarg$ the impact of  a given realization along the path declines for those realizations which are  more temporally distant.
However, we can conservatively bound the  series approximation  errors by using the largest possible $\Delta z_t$ in the formula:
    \begin{gather}
\infNorm{\xWarg-\xWargK} \le \infNorm{(I -F)^{-1} \phi \psi_z}  \infNorm{\Delta z_t } \label{pathErr}
    \end{gather}


\label{sec:pathnorm}

\section{Dynamic Stochastic Time Invariant Maps}
\label{sec:extToMaps}

Many dynamic stochastic models have solutions that 
fall in the class of bounded time invariant maps.
Consequently, if we take care (see Section \ref{sec:convenient}), we can apply the law of iterated expectations, 
to compute conditional expected solution paths 
forward from any initial value $x_{t-1}$
and realization of $\epsilon_t$.\footnote{Economists have long used similar manipulation of
time series paths for dynamic models. 
Indeed, Potter constructs his generalized impulse response functions using
differences in conditional expectations paths.\cite{Potter2000,Koop1996a}
}
Subsequently, we can use the family of conditional expectations paths 
along with a contrived linear reference model to generate
a series representation for the model solutions  and
to approximate errors.

The series representation will provide a linearly weighted sum of $z_t\tArg$ functions that give us an approximation for the model solutions.
So long as the trajectories are 
 bounded, the time invariant maps can 
be represented using the framework from section \ref{sec:newseries}.
In this section I will begin with a familiar RBC model example.\footnote{
Later, in order to handle models with regime switching and occasionally binding constraints, I will need to consider more complicated collections 
of equation systems with  Boolean gates. I will show how to apply the 
series formulation and to approximate the  errors for these models as well.}

%\subsection{Application of the Series Representation to Time Invariant Maps}




% Often these time invariant maps impose additional structure on the time 
% series they generate that allows us to use the series formula to
% develop bounds for the error in the solution.


\subsection{An RBC Example}
\label{sec:rbcaux}
  I consider a model described in \cite{Maliar2005}\footnote{Here, I set their $\beta=1$ and 
do not discuss quasi-geometric discounting or time-inconsistency.}
 \begin{gather*}
   \max\left \{  u(c_t) + E_t \sum_{t=1}^\infty  \delta^{t}u(c_{t+1})\right \}\\
c_t + k_t=(1-d)k_{t-1} + \theta_t f(k_t)\\
f(k_t)= k_t^\alpha\\
u(c)=\frac{c^{1-\eta}-1}{1-\eta}
 \end{gather*}
The first order conditions for the model are

\begin{tcolorbox}[ams gather]
\frac{1}{c_t^{\eta}}=\alpha \delta k_{t}^{\alpha-1} E_t \left (\frac{\theta_{t+1}}{c_{t+1}^\eta} \right ) \\
c_t + k_t=\theta_{t-1}k_{t-1}^\alpha \\
 \theta_t =\theta_{t-1}^\rho e^{\epsilon_t}\label{rbcSys}
 \end{tcolorbox}
\label{sec:rbcexample}

It is well know that when $\eta=d=1$, we have a closed form solution\citep{lettau03}:
\begin{gather}
x_t(\xtmEpsArg)\equiv    \DR(\xtmEpsArg)\equiv
   \begin{bmatrix}
     c_t(\xtmEpsArg)\\k_t(\xtmEpsArg)\\ \theta_t(\xtmEpsArg)
   \end{bmatrix}=
   \begin{bmatrix}
(1-\alpha \delta) \theta_{t} k_{t-1}^\alpha\\
  \alpha \delta \theta_{t} k_{t-1}^\alpha.\label{soln}\\
\theta_{t-1}^\rho e^{\epsilon_t}.
   \end{bmatrix}
\end{gather}
For mean zero iid $\epsilon_t$ we can easily 
compute the conditional expectation of the model variables for any given $\theta_{t+k},k_{t+k}$
\begin{gather*}
  \DRCE(x_{t+k+1})\equiv
  \begin{bmatrix}
  E_t(c_{t+k+1}|\theta_{t+k},k_{t+k})\\
  E_t(k_{t+k+1}|\theta_{t+k},k_{t+k})\\
  E_t(\theta_{t+k+1}|\theta_{t+k},k_{t+k})
  \end{bmatrix}=
  \begin{bmatrix}
(1-\alpha\delta)k_{t+k}^\alpha e^{\frac{\sigma^2}{2}}\theta_{t+k}^\rho\\
\alpha\delta k_{t+k}^\alpha e^{\frac{\sigma^2}{2}}\theta_{t+k}^\rho\\
e^{\frac{\sigma^2}{2}}\theta_{t+k}^\rho
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{gather*}


For any given values of $k_{t-1},\theta_{t-1}, \epsilon_t$, the model decision rule, ($\DR$), and decision rule conditional expectation, ($\DRCE$), can generate a conditional expectations path forward from  any given initial $x_{t-1}$ and $\epsilon_t$:
\begin{gather*}
  \xWOarg_t(\xtmEpsArg)=\DR(\xtmEpsArg)\\
  \xWOarg_{t+k+1}(\xtmEpsArg)=\DRCE(\xWOarg_{t+k}(\xtmEpsArg))
\end{gather*}
and corresponding paths for $\{(z_{1t}\tArg, z_{2t}\tArg, z_{3t}\tArg),\ldots\}$
\begin{gather*}
  z_{t+k} \equiv H_{-1} \xWOarg_{t+k-1} +  H_0 \xWOarg_{t+k} +  H_1 \xWOarg_{t+K+1} 
\end{gather*}
Formula \refeq{theSeries} requires that
\begin{gather*}
%   \begin{bmatrix}
% c_t(k_{t-1},\theta_{t-1}, \epsilon_t)\\
% k_t(k_{t-1},\theta_{t-1}, \epsilon_t)\\
% \theta_t(k_{t-1},\theta_{t-1}, \epsilon_t)
%   \end{bmatrix} \rightarrow
%   \begin{bmatrix}
%   z_{1t}(k_{t-1},\theta_{t-1}, \epsilon_t)\\
%   z_{2t}(k_{t-1},\theta_{t-1}, \epsilon_t)\\
%   z_{3t}(k_{t-1},\theta_{t-1}, \epsilon_t) 
%   \end{bmatrix}\equiv z(k_{t-1},\theta_{t-1}, \epsilon_t)\intertext{where}
%   \begin{bmatrix}
% c_t(k_{t-1},\theta_{t-1}, \epsilon_t)\\
% k_t(k_{t-1},\theta_{t-1}, \epsilon_t)\\
% \theta_t(k_{t-1},\theta_{t-1}, \epsilon_t)
%   \end{bmatrix}  =
\xWOarg(\xtmEpsArg)=
B   \begin{bmatrix}
c_{t-1}\\
k_{t-1}\\
\theta_{t-1}
  \end{bmatrix}  + \phi \psi_\epsilon\epsilon_t + (I - F)^{-1} \phi \psi_c + \sum_{\sForSum=0}^\infty F^s \phi z_{t+\sForSum}(k_{t-1},\theta_{t-1}, \epsilon_t) 
\end{gather*}
% \footnote{
% We need not  make these adjustments for the steady state,
% but doing so economizes on the number of terms 
% required for a given level of approximation
% accuracy.}

For example, using $d=1$ and the following parameter values and using the arbitrary linear reference model \eqref{linRef} we can generate a series representation for the model solutions.

\begin{gather}\label{rbcparams}
\vcenter{\hbox{\includegraphics{RBCParamSubs.pdf}}} \,\, \text{ we have } \,\,
  \begin{bmatrix}
    c_{ss}\\k_{ss} \\ \theta_{ss} 
  \end{bmatrix}=
\left [ \vcenter{\hbox{\includegraphics{RBCSSVal.pdf}}}\right ]
\end{gather}

With 
\begin{gather}\label{theInits}
  \begin{bmatrix}
 k_{t-1}\\\theta_{t-1}\\\epsilon_t 
  \end{bmatrix}=
\left [ \vcenter{\hbox{\includegraphics{anXEps.pdf}}}\right ]
\end{gather}

\includegraphics[width=3.0in]{simprbczvals.pdf}  
  \caption{model variable values and z values}
  \label{rbcpaths}
\end{figure}

The left panel of Figure \refeq{rbcpaths} shows, from top to bottom, the paths of $\theta_t, c_t, \text{ and } k_t$ from the initial values given in Equation \refeq{theInits}.  The right panel shows the paths for the $z_t$ variables associated with the linear reference model. The orange line corresponds to $z_{1t}\tArg$,
the blue line corresponds to $z_{2t}\tArg$ and the green line corresponds to $z_{3t}\tArg$.%\footnote{For now we focus on the times series paths, $z_t(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t)$ for given $(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t)$.  Later we will exploit the information available from explicit investigation of the variation in  $z_t(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t)$ with $(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t)$ to improve solution accuracy and robustness.}

By including enough terms we can compute the solution for $x_t$ 
exactly.
Figure \ref{rbcTrunc} shows the impact that truncating the series has 
on approximation of the time t values of the state variables.   The approximated magnitude for the error, $B_n$, shown in red 
 is again very pessimistic compared to the actual error, $Z_n$, shown in blue.
With enough terms, even using an ``almost'' arbitrarily chosen linear model,  the series approximation provides a machine precision accurate value for the time t state vector.  Thus we have wide latitude in choosing a linear reference model.

Figure \ref{rbcTruncSimp} shows that using a 
linearization that better tracks the 
nonlinear model paths, improves the approximation $Z_n$, shown in blue  and the approximate error  $B_n$ shown in red.
Using the linearization of the RBC model around the ergodic mean produces a tighter but still pessimistic bound on the errors for the initial state vector.
Again, the first few terms make most of the difference in approximating the value of the state variables.


\subsection{A Model Specification Constraint}
\label{sec:convenient}



For convenience of notation in what follows, 
we will focus on models built up from components of the form
\begin{gather}
  h_i(x_{t-1},x_{t},x_{t+1},\epsilon_t)=h^{det}_{io}(x_{t-1},x_{t},\epsilon_t)+\sum_{j=1}^{p_i} [h^{det}_{ij}(x_{t-1},x_{t},\epsilon_t)h^{nondet}_{ij}(x_{t+1})]=0
\end{gather}
This is a very broad class of models including most widely used
macroeconomics models.  This constraint will make it easier to write
down and manipulate the conditional expectations expressions in the
description of the algorithms in subsequent sections.

For example, the Euler equations for the  neoclassical growth  model 
\label{sec:simple-rbc-model-ext} can be written as
\begin{gather}
h_{10^{det}}(\cdot)=\frac{1}{c_t^\eta},\,\,
h_{11}^{det}()=\alpha \delta k_{t}^{\alpha-1} ,\,\,
h_{11}^{nondet}(\cdot)=E_t \left (\frac{\theta_{t+1}}{c_{t+1}^\eta} \right )\\
h_{20}^{det}(\cdot)=c_t + k_t-\theta_tk_{t-1}^\alpha,\,\,
h_{21}^{det}(\cdot)=0\\
h_{30}^{det}(\cdot)=\ln \theta_t -(\rho \ln \theta_{t-1} + \epsilon_t),\,\,
h_{31}^{det}(\cdot)=0
\end{gather}
Since we   need to compute 
the conditional expectation of nonlinear expressions,  
this setup will make it possible for us to use auxiliary
variables to correctly compute the required expected values.

We will be working with models where expectations are computed at time t, with  $\epsilon_t$  known,  the only stochastic components are those with time subscripts greater than $t$. 
For example, we can reconstruct a linear reference model for the modified RBC system
by  augmenting the RBC model with the equation 
\begin{tcolorbox}[ams gather]
  \rcpC_t=\frac{\theta_t}{c_t}
\end{tcolorbox}
\noindent
substituting $\rcpC_{t+1}$ for $\frac{\theta_{t+1}}{c_{t+1}}$ 
in the first equation and 
 linearizing the RBC model about the ergodic mean.

This 
leads to:
{\small
\begin{gather}
  \begin{bmatrix}
H_{-1}&H_{0}&H_{1} 
  \end{bmatrix}=\\
\vcenter{\hbox{\includegraphics{RBCHmatSymb.pdf}}} \label{rbcLinSys}
\intertext{with}
\psi_\epsilon=
\begin{bmatrix}
  0\\0\\1\\0
\end{bmatrix}, \psi_z=I
\end{gather}%(\footnote{generated by AMAPaperCalcs.mth {RBCHmatSymb.pdf}})
}
These coefficients  produce a unique stable linear solution.

\begin{gather}
  B=
\vcenter{\hbox{\includegraphics{RBCBmatSymb.pdf}}},
\phi=
\vcenter{\hbox{\includegraphics{RBCPhimatSymb.pdf}}}\\
F=
\vcenter{\hbox{\includegraphics{RBCFmatSymb.pdf}}}\\
\psi_c=\vcenter{\hbox{\includegraphics{RBCPsissSymb.pdf}}}
\end{gather}
Recomputing the truncation errors with the expanded model produces very similar
results for the variable approximation errors.


\section{Approximating Model Solution Errors}
\label{sec:solnerrorbounds}


The paper shows how to write a series representation for any proposed
model solution and to characterize the series representation for a typically
unknown solution in such a way that one can use the model equation errors  to construct an approximate error for the norm of the distance between the proposed and the exact solution.

This work contrasts with the analysis provided in
\cite{judd2017lower,peralta-alva14,santos2005accuracy,Santos2000accuracy}. 
Their approaches identify Euler Equation Errors, but use statistical techniques to estimate the impact of these errors on solution accuracy.  Here I provide
a formula for the approximate error that does not require statistical inference.\marginpar{calculate using their error?}





\subsection{An Error Approximation Formula}
\label{sec:errorformula}

We can construct an error approximation for proposed model solutions.
Consider a bounded region, $\bndRgn$, that contains all iterated conditional expectations paths.
  By bounding the largest deviation in the paths for the $\Delta z_t^p$ we can bound the largest deviation in a proposed solution from the exact solution. 



Given an exact solution $x^\star_t=g^\star(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t)$ define the conditional expectations function,
  \begin{gather}
G^\star(x)\equiv\expct{g^\star(x,\epsilon)} \intertext{then with}
E_tx^\star_{t+1}=G^\star(g^\star(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t)) \intertext{we have}
    \label{eq:2}
\eqnFunc(x^\star_{t-1},x^\star_t,E_tx^\star_{t+1},\epsilon_t)=0  \,\, \forall  (x_{t-1},\epsilon_t)\\ 
   x^\star_t(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t) \in{R^L}\,\,\twoNorm{x^\star_t(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t)}  \le \overline{\mathcal{X}}\,\,\forall t\ > 0
  \end{gather}

Now consider a proposed solution for the model,
 $x^p_t=g^p(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t)$ define
$G^p(x)\equiv\expct{g^p(x,\epsilon)}$  so that 
  \begin{gather*}
E_tx_{t+1}=G^p(g^p(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t))\\
\mathbf{e}_t^p(x_{t-1},\epsilon)\equiv
\eqnFunc(x_{t-1},x^p_t,E_tx^p_{t+1},\epsilon_t)
\end{gather*}


    \begin{gather*}
	\infNorm{ x^\star_{t}(x_{t-1},\epsilon) -	 x^p_{t}(x_{t-1},\epsilon)} \le
\max_{\{x_{-},\epsilon\}} \twoNorm{(I-F)^{-1} \phi \eqnFunc(x_{-},g^p(x_{-},\epsilon),G^p(g^p(x_{-},\epsilon)),\epsilon) }\intertext{which can be approximated by}
    \max_{x_{t-1},\epsilon_t} (\phi \mathbf{e}_t^p(x_{t-1},\epsilon))^2
  \end{gather*}

For proof see Appendix \ref{sec:error-bound-formula}.  

\section{Improving Proposed  Solutions}
\label{sec:algoforsoln}


\subsection{Generalization and Practical Considerations for Applying the Series Formula}
\label{sec:practicalformula}

% The framework provides a new way to bound the error one can expect from
% employing a given proposed model solution and leads, in Section \ref{sec:algoforsoln},, to an
% algorithm with  components similar to parameterized expectations that
% one can use to improve proposed solutions. In that section, the
% series representation makes
% it possible to organize the calculation around computing a deterministic
% problem at time t given a proposed solution.  The deterministic solution
% can accommodate inequality constraints or alternative regimes to produce a
% solution for each set of initial conditions.  One can typically arrange,
% perhaps by adding auxiliary variables, to produce a ``decision rule''
% that one can use to correctly precompute a deterministic conditional
% expectation function that can be iterated forward and serves to
% improve upon the original proposed solution.
% Time invariant stochastic functions 
% lead naturally to an associated family of deterministic maps
% which can be conveniently represented by the series representation.


% The paper studies a very general class of models whose 
% solutions are characterized by $\eqnFuncSys$, an
%  exhaustive and mutually exclusive set 
% of   triples, $\eqnFuncSysI{i}\equiv\{\eqnFunc_i,\preGate_i,\postGate_i\}$, with model equations,  $\eqnFunc_i$,  and Boolean valued gates, $\preGate_i$, $\postGate_i$. 
% that together determine a unique  solution  $x_t\tArg$
%\begin{gather}
%\intertext{ where, each }
%\eqnFuncSysI{i}\equiv \eqnFuncSysIExpl{i} \label{eqnGates}
%\end{gather}




To fix notation,  assume that we have a countable collection of equations systems.
I will require that, for any 
 given $(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t)$,  this collection of 
systems of equations produces a unique solution for $x_t$.  
Using the convention described in section \ref{sec:convenient},
 we will include 
enough auxiliary variables so that we can correctly compute expected values
for model variables by applying the law of iterated 
expectations.

It will be convenient for describing the algorithms to
write the model in the form
\begin{gather}
\eqnFuncSys \intertext{ where, each }
\eqnFuncSysI{i}\equiv \eqnFuncSysIExpl{i} \label{eqnGates}
\end{gather}
 represents a set of model equations, $\eqnFunc_i$,  with Boolean valued gate, $\preGate_i, \postGate_i$. Thus, we will have an equation system and  corresponding gatekeeper logical expressions 
indicating which equation system is in force for producing the unique
solution for a give $x_{t-1}, \epsilon_t$.\footnote{It sometimes proves 
practical and 
useful to construct a post-processing gatekeeper to select the unique $x_t$
from among competing potential solutions.}
I will only consider time invariant model solutions $x_t=\xWarg$.  Given a decision rule $\xWarg$, we have its conditional expectation $\XWOarg(x_{t-1})\equiv \expct{\xWarg}$. 


  Examples of such systems include simple cases like
typical DSGE models that have one
system of equations, or models with 
occasionally binding constraints with solutions 
exhibiting demonstrating complementary slackness, or models with 
regime switching .  See the appendix for an example 
of a specification for occasionally binding constraints(\ref{sec:occbind}) 
and for regime switching)(\ref{sec:ressw}).






\subsection{An Informal Characterization  of the Algorithm}
\label{sec:walkthrough}


Before presenting the pseudo-code for the algorithm, it may be worthwhile
to characterize  how the approach I propose here differs from 
what is typically done for solving dynamic stochastic models.
As with the standard approach I characterize the solutions using a linearly
weighted sums of orthogonal polynomials and solve the model equations
at predetermined collocation points. However, in this new algorithm, I 
augment the model Euler equations with equations based on \refeq{theSeries}
 that link the conditional expectations for future values in
the proposed solution with the
time t value of the model variables.  As a result, the algorithm determines
linearly weighted polynomials characterizing the 
trajectories for the traditional
variables $x_t(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t)$ as well as new  $z_t(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t)$ variables.  These new constraints 
help keep proposed solutions bounded during the algorithmic iterations 
for improving solution accuracy.


I closely follow the techniques outlined in \cite{Judd2013,Judd2014}. 
I use their an-isotropic Smolyak Lagrange interpolation with adaptive domain.
I also precompute all of the conditional expectations for the integrals as outlined in \cite{JuddIntegrals} so that the time t computations are all 
deterministic.


% \begin{itemize}
% \item show describe $z_t(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t)$ for RBC
% \item start linear.  check error bounds, if adequate done
% \item traditional iteration ignores the path constraints on initial solution leading to larger errors on $\bndRgn^p$
% \item It's a good idea to compute easy approximation using just the linear model one ieration to get an approximation for the ergodic set
% \item PEA moving bounds \cite{maliarmovingbounds}
% \item them simulate and make the Maliar SVD transformation
% \item then iterate on the ergodic set till it settles down
% \item in this way can avoid solutions which are explosive when iterated 
% \item need to see if this works when honoring complimentary slackness
% \item not related to z transform. probably should change z's
% \end{itemize}


\subsection{Algorithm Overview}

% \subsubsection{Approximating an Unknown Solution: $U(c) \ne Log(c)$ }
 \label{sec:unknown-solutions}
The algorithm uses a proposed decision rule characterized by a linearly weighted sum of Chebyshev polynomials with precomputed integrals.  Since the
orthogonal polynomials have been integrated, the linearly weighted sum provides
the conditional expectations function needed for computing conditional expectations paths from each collocation point forward.  This provides the 
expected future values for the $z_t$ needed for the series representation.
The algorithm then solves
a deterministic problem at time t to improve the proposed solution.
The algorithm can easily accommodate inequality
constraints or regime switching.\footnote{See sections \ref{sec:occbind} and \ref{sec:regime-switch-model} characterizing  models with regime switching.}


{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Consider the single model case $  \eqnFunc(x_{t-1},x_t,\expct{x_{t+1}},\epsilon)=0$.  
\item We seek $\eqnFunc(x_{t-1},\xWOarg^\star\tArg,\XWOarg^\star(\xWOarg^\star\tArg),\epsilon)=0\,\,\forall \tArg $
\item Given a proposed model solution $x_t=\xWOarg^p\tArg$ compute $\XWOarg^p(x_{t-1})\equiv \expct{\xWOarg^p\tArg}$. 
\item we will use a linear reference model $\linMod  \equiv \linModMats$ 
to construct a series of $\zpWOarg$ functions that improve the accuracy of the proposed solution.
\end{itemize}
}



\begin{gather*}
 \intertext{We can define functions $\zpWOarg,\ZpWOarg$ by}
\zpWarg\equiv H
\begin{bmatrix}
x_{t-1}\\ \xpWarg\\ \XpWOarg(\xWarg)
\end{bmatrix}+\phi_\epsilon \epsilon_t+\phi_c\\
\ZpWOarg(x_{t-1})\equiv \expct{\zpWarg}
\end{gather*}
 \begin{itemize}
\item  {\color{blue}Algorithm loop begins here.} Define conditional expectations paths for $x_t, z_t$ 
 \begin{gather*}
 x_{t+k+1}=\XWOarg(x_{t+k}),\,\,\,z_{t+k+1}=\ZWOarg(x_{t+k})\,\,\,\,  \forall k\ge 0      \end{gather*}
% \item
% it will be useful to construct an augmented decision rule,
% $\ADR\tArg\equiv
%   \begin{bmatrix}
%     x^p\tArg\\z^p\tArg
%   \end{bmatrix}$, initially $z^p\tArg=0$
   \end{itemize}

{Using the $\zpWarg$ Series}
{\small
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We get expressions for $x_t,\,\, \expct x_{t+1}$ consistent with $\linMod$ and the conditional expectations path
   \begin{gather*}
     \mathcal{X}_{t} =B x_{t-1}+ \phi \psi_\epsilon\epsilon + (I - F)^{-1} \phi \psi_c + \sum_{\sForSum=0}^\infty F^s \phi \ZWOarg(x_{t+\nu})\\
	\expct{ \mathcal{X}_{t+1}} =B \mathcal{X}_{t}  + (I - F)^{-1} \phi \psi_c+ \sum_{\sForSum =0}^\infty F^{\sForSum-1} \phi \ZWOarg(x_{t+\nu}) \,\,\,\,\,\forall t,k \ge  0
\end{gather*}
\item Use the model equations, $\eqnFuncSys$ and $x_t\tArg=\mathcal{X}_t\tArg$\\ to determine $\xppWarg, \zppWarg$
\item $\xpWarg=\xppWarg, \zpWarg=\zppWarg$ -- {\color{blue}Repeat loop.}
  \end{itemize}
}

Here is an outline of the routines that implement the algorithm. 
Figure \ref{calltree}
provides a graphic depiction of the function call tree. For more algorithmic detail, see Appendix \ref{sec:pseudocode}. 
The current implementation, written in  Mathematica,
  has a couple of atypical features.  
Many of the calculations exploit Mathematica's capability to blend
numerical and symbolic computation and to easily use functions as arguments for
other functions.  In addition, the implementation exploits parallelism at
several points. Below, I note where these features play a role.

\subsection{Approximating the Known Solution: $U(c) = Log(c)$ }
\label{sec:recov-known-solut}

This subsection uses the series representation to
compute the solution for the case when the exact solution is known and
to compare the various approximations to the known actual solution.
In what follows, both the traditional and the new  approach use an-isotropic
Smolyak polynomial function approximation with precomputed expectations.
Figure \ref{fig:erg}  characterizes the use of the parallelotope
transformation described in \cite{Judd2013}. The left panel shows the 200 values of $k_t$ and $\theta_t$ resulting from a stochastic simulation of the the known decision rule. The right panel shows the transformed variables that constitute
an improved set of variables for constructing function approximation values.

In order to evaluate how well the error approximation works, compute and
fix a particular decision rule as a proposed solution and I 
experiment with various parameterization of the 
RBC with known analytic solutions.
Consequently, I hold $\eta=d=1$ but approximate the model solution error 
for 50 various  parameter settings
\begin{gather*}
 0.20 <\alpha<0.40,\,\,0.85<\delta<0.99,\,\,0.85<\rho<0.99,\,\,0.005<\sigma<0.015
\end{gather*}
I do this approximation for 50 various values of 
$(k_{t-1},\theta_{t-1},\epsilon_t)$ generated using the Niederreiter algorithm
 covering the ergodic set.  I do this for values of k from 0 to 20.  The static proposed solution comes from linearizing
the RBC model around the deterministic steady state for
 the parameter settings in \ref{rbcparams}.  
solution path.  I use the statically selected decision rule and its conditional
expectation to construct the paths required in the error formula.

I used the Niedererreiter number theoretic algorithm to generated highly 
dispersed test points throughout the ergodic region.\cite{niederreiter88,Xu2005}
For the given set of parameters, I computed the exact solution.
I chose a wide array of different degrees of  approximation for the
Smolyak polynomials and for each given degree of approximation I applied
the error formula to approximate the error at each of
the test points.  I ran a regression using the formula approximation as a right
hand side variable along with a constant to predict the true error.
Varying k from 0 to 20 consistently  produces $R^2$ near one, tiny standard errors and a coefficient on the estimated error very near one.

\section{Robust Calculations}

 

Many global methods propose a solution and update the solution by solving
the original system of equations with the previous iterations guess.
These iterations are notorious for going off track.
The series representation provides a useful additional constraint on the 
evolution of proposed solution in the algorithm.
To demonstrate this phenomenon, 
I experimented with an RBC model with occasionally binding constraints.

For a given set of parameters, I computed a deterministic 
steady state for the non binding solution.  I discarded
those parameter values that produced a negative steady state for capital or 
consumption.  For each set of parameters,
I linearized the model at the steady state and computed
the linear perfect foresight solution to use as the linear reference model and
as an initial guess for the equation system.

In order to test the effectiveness of the 
algorithm for model convergence I use Nied to generate model parameters.
I discarded those parameters which failed to produce 
I computed

It will be useful to explore the computational aspects of choosing the right value for k.  Zero seems to improve reliability.
It will be important to work on exploiting the high degree of parallelism 
available.

It should be possible to maintain a small footprint communication would involve
sending the coefficient matrices for Smolyak calculation.  These nodes
should use efficient polynomial composition to compute conditional expectations
paths .
\section{Conclusions}
This paper introduces a new series representation for bounded time series and
shows how to apply the series for representing bounded time invariant maps.
This representation proves useful because the solutions for many
dynamic stochastic economic models fall in this class.
The series representation plays a strategic role in developing a formula for approximating the errors in dynamic model solution decision rules.  The paper
also shows how to  augment traditional ``Euler Equation'' model solution
methods with constraints reflecting how the updated
conditional expectation paths impact the time t solution values.
The current prototype was written in Mathematica,  I have begun work on developing a Julia version.
\marginpar{parallelism measure}\marginpar{julia}
\marginpar{just the first term.}
\marginpar{Large model multiple errors}


There are many directions to pursue in future work.
I will investigate computational efficiency issues and further
exploit the high degree of parallelism available in the algorithm.
It seems likely that the technique can provide a way to improve 
the performance of  perturbation method
decision rules by incorporating global information about the solution.
The procedures should prove useful
in handling dynamic economies with occasionally binding constraints\citep{holden15:_exist_dsge,guerrieri15:_occbin} and regime switching.

\section{Error Approximation Formula Proof}
\label{sec:error-bound-formula}


We consider time invariant maps such as often arise from solving an
 optimization problem codified in a systems of equations.  
In what follows, we construct an error approximation for proposed model solutions.
Consider a bounded region, $\bndRgn$, where all iterated conditional expectations paths remain bounded.
 Given an exact solution $x^\star_t=g^\star(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t)$ define the conditional expectations function,
  \begin{gather}
G^\star(x)\equiv\expct{g^\star(x,\epsilon)} \intertext{then with}
E_tx^\star_{t+1}=G^\star(g^\star(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t)) \intertext{we have}
    \eqnFunc(x^\star_{t-1},x^\star_t,E_tx^\star_{t+1},\epsilon_t)=0  \,\, \forall  (x_{t-1},\epsilon_t)\\ \intertext{In words, the exact solution  exactly satisfies the model equations.  Using $G^\star$ and $\linMod$, construct the family of trajectories and corresponding $z^\star_t(x_{t-1},\epsilon)$ }
   x^\star_t(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t) \in{R^L}\,\,\twoNorm{x^\star_t(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t)}  \le \bar{\mathcal{X}}\,\,\forall t\ > 0
  \end{gather}
   \begin{align}
   z^\star_{t}(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t) \equiv& H_{-1}  x^\star_{t-1}(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t) + \nonumber\\
 & H_0  x^\star_{t}(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t) +   \\
 & H_1  x^\star_{t+1}(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t). \nonumber
   \end{align}




   Consequently, the exact solution has a representation given by
	 \begin{gather}
	 x^\star_{t}(x_{t-1},\epsilon) =B x_{t-1}+ \phi \psi_\epsilon\epsilon + (I - F)^{-1} \phi \psi_c +\\ \sum_{\sForSum=0}^\infty F^s \phi z^\star_{t+\sForSum}(x_{t-1},\epsilon) \intertext{and}
	 \expct{x^\star_{t+1}(x_{t-1},\epsilon)} =B x^\star_{t+k} + \sum_{\sForSum =0}^\infty F^\sForSum \phi \expct{z^\star_{t+1+\sForSum}(x_{t-1},\epsilon)} + (I - F)^{-1} \phi \psi_c 
 \intertext{with}
 \eqnFunc(x_{t-1},x^\star_t,E_tx^\star_{t+1},\epsilon_t)=0  \,\, \forall  (x_{t-1},\epsilon_t)\\ 
	 \end{gather}

Now consider a proposed solution for the model,
 $x^p_t=g^p(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t)$ define
$G^p(x)\equiv\expct{g^p(x,\epsilon)}$  so that 
  \begin{gather*}
E_tx_{t+1}=G^p(g^p(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t))\\
\mathbf{e}_t^p(x_{t-1},\epsilon)\equiv
\eqnFunc(x_{t-1},x^p_t,E_tx^p_{t+1},\epsilon_t)
\end{gather*}
By construction,  the conditional expectations paths will all be bounded
in the region $\bndRgn^p$. Using $G^p$ and $\linMod$ construct the family of trajectories and corresponding $z^p_t(x_{t-1},\epsilon)$\footnote{The algorithm presented below for finding solutions provides a mechanism for generating such proposed solutions.} 
\begin{gather*}
   x^p_t(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t) \in{R^L}\,\,\twoNorm{x^p_t(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t)}  \le \bar{\mathcal{X}}\,\,\forall t\ > 0
  \end{gather*}
   \begin{align}
   z^p_{t}(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t) \equiv& H_{-1}  x^p_{t-1}(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t) + \nonumber\\
 & H_0  x^p_{t}(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t) +   \\
 & H_1  x^p_{t+1}(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t). \nonumber
   \end{align}








 The proposed solution has a representation given by 
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:4}
	 x^p_{t}(x_{t-1},\epsilon) =B x_{t-1}+ \phi \psi_\epsilon\epsilon + (I - F)^{-1} \phi \psi_c +\\ \sum_{\sForSum=0}^\infty F^s \phi z^p_{t+\sForSum}(x_{t-1},\epsilon) 
 \intertext{and}
 	 \expct{x^p_{t+1}(x_{t-1},\epsilon)} =B x^p_{t+k} + \sum_{\sForSum =0}^\infty F^\sForSum \phi z^p_{t+1+\sForSum}(x_{t-1},\epsilon) + (I - F)^{-1} \phi \psi_c \intertext{with}
\mathbf{e}_t^p(x_{t-1},\epsilon)\equiv
\eqnFunc(x_{t-1},x^p_t,E_tx^p_{t+1},\epsilon_t)
  \end{gather}




  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:3}
	 x^\star_{t}(x_{t-1},\epsilon) -	 x^p_{t}(x_{t-1},\epsilon) =
         \sum_{\sForSum=0}^\infty F^s \phi (z^\star_{t+\sForSum}(x_{t-1},\epsilon)-z^p_{t+\sForSum}(x_{t-1},\epsilon))     \\
\Delta z_{t+\sForSum}^p(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t)         \equiv (z^\star_{t+\sForSum}(x_{t-1},\epsilon)-z^p_{t+\sForSum}(x_{t-1},\epsilon))\\
	 x^\star_{t}(x_{t-1},\epsilon) -	 x^p_{t}(x_{t-1},\epsilon) =
\sum_{\sForSum=0}^\infty F^s \phi \Delta z_{t+\sForSum}^p(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t)   \\ 
	\infNorm{ x^\star_{t}(x_{t-1},\epsilon) -	 x^p_{t}(x_{t-1},\epsilon)} \le
\sum_{\sForSum=0}^\infty F^s \phi \infNorm{\Delta z_{t+\sForSum}^p(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t)}    
  \end{gather}

  By bounding the largest deviation in the paths for the $\Delta z_t^p$ we can bound the largest difference in $x_t$.\footnote{Since the future values are probability weighted averages of the $\Delta z_t^p$ values for the given initial conditions and the condition expectations paths remain in the region $\bndRgn^p$,
the largest error for $\Delta z_{t+k}^p$   are pessimistic bounds for the errors from the conditional expectations path. } The exact solution satisfies the model equations exactly.  The error associated with the proposed solution leads to a conservative bound on the largest change in $z$ needed to match the exact solution.

\subsection{Occasionally Binding Constraints}
\label{sec:occbind}



\label{sec:obc-solut}

Stochastic dynamic non linear economic
models increasingly embody  occasionally binding constraints (OBC).
Since \cite{Christiano2000} a host of
authors have described a variety of approaches.\footnote{The algorithms described \cite{holden15:_exist_dsge} and \cite{guerrieri15:_occbin} also exploit the use of ``anticipated shocks'', but do not use the comprehensive formula employed here. }
\cite{holden15:_exist_dsge,guerrieri15:_occbin,benigno09,hintermaier10,brumm10,nakov08,haefke98,nakata12,gordon11,billi11,Hintermaier2010,Guerrieri2015}

\subsection{Regime Switching}
\label{sec:ressw}


\subsubsection{Regime Switching}


\label{sec:regime-switch-model}

To apply the series formula, one must construct conditional expectations paths from each initial $x(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t)$.  Consider the case when the transition 
probabilities $p_{ij}$ are constant and do not depend on 
$x_{t-1},\epsilon_t,x_t$.

\begin{gather*}
E_t[x_{t+1}]=  \sum_{j=1}^{N} p_{ij} E_t(x_{t+1}(x_t)|s_{t+1}=j)  \\
E_t[x_{t+2}]=  \sum_{j=1}^{N} p_{ij} E_t(x_{t+2}(x_{t+1})|s_{t+2}=j)  \\
\end{gather*}

If we know the current state we can use the known conditional expectation function for the state:
\begin{gather*}
    \begin{bmatrix}
E_t(x_{t+1}(x_{t})|s_{t}=1)  \\    \vdots \\
E_t(x_{t+1}(x_{t})|s_{t}=N)  
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{gather*}

For the next state we can compute expectations if the errors are independent
\begin{gather*}
  \begin{bmatrix}
E_t(x_{t+2}(x_t)|s_{t}=1)  \\    \vdots \\
E_t(x_{t+2}(x_t)|s_{t}=N)  
  \end{bmatrix}=
(P \otimes  I)
  \begin{bmatrix}
E_t(x_{t+2}(x_{t+1})|s_{t+1}=1)  \\    \vdots \\
E_t(x_{t+2}(x_{t+1})|s_{t+1}=N)  
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{gather*}

Consider two states $s_t \in {0,1}$ where the depreciation rates are different:  $d_0>d_1$

\begin{gather}
    Prob(s_t=j|s_{t-1}=i)=p_{ij}

% \section{Multi-cluster Sequential Number Theoretic Optimization (MSNTO)}
% \label{sec:MSNTO}

% This section describes a method for finding maxima in a closed bounded domain.
% Let $D=[a,b]$ in $R^s$ where $a_i \le x_i \le b_i$. We want to find  $M=f(x^\ast)= \max_{x \in D}f(x)$.
% Th number theoretic (Quasi-Monte Carlo) approached is designed for finding optima with many local optima.  It is based on the used of space filling points.\cite{Xu2005}
% The number theoretic method of optimization includes two basic steps.
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Choose a set $p=x_i, i=1,\dots,n$ of potential optima that are uniformly scattered.
% \item Find $M_n\text{ and } x^\ast \in p =\max_{1\le i \le n}f(x_i)$
% \end{enumerate}

% Even when choosing $p$ wisely convergence slow until \cite{Niederreiter1983}.  They speed up the convergence by contracting the domain.
% Their algorithm discards all but the best in the domain. Must have very many points to guarantee choosing a point close to the optimum.


% MSNTO selects a finite number of sample points uniformly scattered on D.  Next it discard inferior points retaining small sample of potential maxima.  These form the clusters for the next step.  The algorithm performs a domain contraction on each of the clusters.

% \section{The doIt Graphs}
% \label{sec:doit-graphs}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item iterations needed for convergence differ between series and traditional
% \item approx series (1,1,1),1,1  bound violated only case so far
% \item after K >2 better than traditional
% \item should do unit free
% \item perturbation solution
% \item error bounds may decrease and then start to increase with adding K or nuimber of iters  theRes has info to check iters
% \item nminimize to msnto
% \item bounds without approximation 
% \item include epsilon value in graph
% \end{itemize}

% K has no effect on traditional

% Looks like largest errors for nonzero epsilon but graph seems to indicate error at collocation point.

% Why doItApproxSeries[1*{1,1,1},1,1] not good error bound.

% Compute exact error bound.

% \subsection{Ergodic Partition of Invariant Sets}
% \label{sec:ergod-part-invar}

% Following \citep{ergodicvisual}, consider a map $T$ on a compact metric space $\mathcal{A}$ endowed with a measure $\mu$ preserved under $T$. We wish to 
% visualize invariant sets $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{A}$.

% \begin{gather*}
%   x_{t+1} =T x_t,\in A\,\,\forall t \in Z
% \end{gather*}

% \begin{gather*}
%   x_0 \in B \implies T^t x_0 \in B \,\,\forall t \in Z
% \end{gather*}

% For ergodic invariant sets, consider $L^1$ real valued functions on A
% \begin{gather*}
%  f:A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\in L^1(A) \iff \int_A |f(x)|dx <\infty
% \end{gather*}

% Define time average $f^\ast(x_0)$ of a function $f\in L^1(A)$ corresponding to a phase point $x_0\in A$
% \begin{gather*}
%   f^\ast(x_0)\equiv \lim_{t\rightarrow\infty} \frac{1}{t}\sum_{k=0}^{t-1}f(T^kx_0)
% \end{gather*}

% By the Ergodic Theorem, this limit exists almost everywhere ( a. e. ).
% Call map T ergodic over $B \subset A$ if for a. . point  $x_0 \in B$ time average equals the space average for every function $f \in L^1(B)$ so that there exists an
% ergodic measure.
% \begin{gather*}
% f^\ast(x_0) =\frac{1}{\mu_B(B)}\int_B f d\mu_B  
% \end{gather*}
% a.e. $B \subset A$

% This implies $f^\ast$ is a constant a. e. in $B \subset A$  almost every orbit starting in B covers B densey at the limit.  Each $f^\ast$ is an invariant function $f^\ast(x_0)= f^\ast(T^tx_0) \, \forall t$  
% The set of real numbers induces a partition of A called $\zeta_f\equiv \{B_a\}_{a\in\mathbb{R}}$ through a function $f\in L^1(A)$

% \begin{gather*}
%   B_a=(f^\ast)^{-1}(a), \,\,\forall a \in \mathbb{R}
% \end{gather*}
% Some of $B_a$ may be empty.

% \begin{gather*}
%   \mu\left (\bigcup_aB_a \right )=\mu(A),B_a\cap B_{a^\prime} = \emptyset ,\,\,\forall a \ne a^\prime
% \end{gather*}
% Denote set of points with no time average of $f$ by $\Sigma(f,T)$

% \begin{gather*}
%   A=(\cup_aB_a)\bigcup \Sigma(f,T)
% \end{gather*}
% To guarantee we don't lump what should be independent invariant sets together just because averages match, define using a collection of functions.
% Final ergodic partation $\zeta_e$ product of all $zeta_f$ belonging to $S \subset L^1(A)$  Chose S as a basis for $L^1(A)$

% \begin{gather*}
%   \zeta_e= \bigvee_{f\in S} \zeta_f
% \end{gather*}

% Ergodic partition divides phase space into non-decomposable invariant sewts.  Can visualize using approximate ergodic partitions.

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Set up a grid of initial grid-points
% \item Pick N function $\{f_1,\ldots,f_N\}$ from $L^1(A)$ and compute partial time averages for $t_{final}$ iterations for each grid point.  These serve as approximations for $\{f_1^\ast,\ldots,f_N^\ast\}$
% \item To every initial grid point associate the corresponding time average vector
%   \begin{gather*}
%     x \rightarrow \bar{f}(x),\,\, \bar{f}(x)\equiv \{f_1^\ast(x),\ldots,f_N^\ast(x)\}\in \mathbb{R}^N
%   \end{gather*}
% \item Observe the distribution of time average vectors $\bar{f}$ and group them into clusters

\begin{enumerate}
\item Specify a (collection of) model equations systems(s) 
as in \refeq{eqnGates}.
For all relevant values of $\tArg$ there is one and only one solution $x_t\tArg$
\item specify a linear reference model
\item specify an initial guess for decision rule $\xWargK$ obtain conditional expectations function
\item decide upon the ranges for variables and the degrees of approximation for the an-isotropic Smolyak polynomial representation
\item decide upon $K$, the number of conditional expectations function recursive iterations.  Fewer means more truncation error. In effect, 
the algorithm imposes nonlinear constraints the for number of period specified 
and uses the linear reference model thereafter(ie $z_{t+N}=0, \forall N>K$
\item algorithm uses conditional expectation and model equations to produce an improved approximation to the decision rule.
\item the algorithm finds a solution to the system that constrains $x_t= x_g$ determining $x_t,z_t$ at the interpolation points for $x_{t-1},\epsilon_t$  This can be done in parallel
\item the data from the interpolation points is used to produce an updated decision rule
\end{enumerate}



It will be convenient for describing the algorithms to
 augment the model equations to include auxiliary variables so that we can write the model in the form
$  \eqnFunc(x_{t-1},x_t,\expct{x_{t+1}},\epsilon)=0$.  We will consider time invariant model solutions $x_t=\xWarg$.  Compute $\XWOarg(x_{t-1})\equiv \expct{\xWarg}$. We will have

\begin{gather}
\eqnFunc(x_{t-1},\xWarg,\XWOarg(\xWarg),\epsilon)=0 \intertext{Given a linear reference model,}
\linMod  \equiv \linModMats \intertext{we can define functions $\zWOarg$ by}

	 \mathcal{X}_{t} =B x_{t-1}+ \phi \psi_\epsilon\epsilon + (I - F)^{-1} \phi \psi_c + \sum_{\sForSum=0}^\infty F^s \phi z_{t+\sForSum} 
\intertext{and}
	 \mathcal{X}_{t+1} =B \mathcal{X}_{t}  + (I - F)^{-1} \phi \psi_c+ \sum_{\sForSum =0}^\infty F^\sForSum \phi z_{t+\sForSum+1} \,\,\,\,\,\forall t,k \ge  0 \\
	\expct{ \mathcal{X}_{t+1}} =B \mathcal{X}_{t}  + (I - F)^{-1} \phi \psi_c+ \sum_{\sForSum =0}^\infty F^\sForSum \phi \expct{z_{t+\sForSum+1}} \,\,\,\,\,\forall t,k \ge  0\\

\end{gather}





The $g$ function uses equation \ref{theSeries} to construct values needed to evaluate the model equations.
\begin{gather}
  g(x_{t-1},\epsilon_t,z_t)=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    x_{t-1}\\

We will represent model solutions using the an-isotropic Smolyak interpolation method outlined in \cite{Judd2014}.\footnote{ This choice makes it possible to precompute all the integrals necessary for the conditional expectations calculations.}  This will require solving
the following system at a prespecified number of points.  This can be done in parallel. We can use the linear system associated with some 
linear reference model, $\linMod$, as the initial guess.  
It is not necessary, but it may be useful to use some linearization of the model, $\eqnFunc$.  Typically one would start with the initial values for $z_t\tArg=0$.

From the  trial value for the model solution codified in the $\ADR$, $\xWOarg^k\tArg$, we obtain the corresponding $\ADRCE$, $\XWOarg^k\tNo$ and, as
 shown in algorithm \ref{fSum}, using
a guess for $x_t\tArg$ we compute a conditional expectations path of length N from $\tArg$ forward.  We use the $\ADRCE$\ expressions for $Z^k$ to compute the expected values for future $z_t$. As shown in algorithm \ref{gEqn}, we 
will use these values in the formula \ref{theSeries} to compute $x_t$ and $\expct{x_{t+1}}$. Algorithm \ref{gEqn} provides all the arguments needed for solving the equation system, $\eqnFunc$.  Algorithm \ref{theSys} obtains  $\xWOarg^k\tArg,\zWOarg^k\tArg$ at the designated points so that the model equations are satisfied and the $\xguss=x$

% \label{sec:future}

% \begin{itemize}
%  \item Perturbation Occ bind zeroth order and $\phi=0$
% \item perturbation global information better than pruning max convergent region
% \item parallelMap don't need order, so ParallelTry  four args pretest posttest xvals keep all except failed  be sure to fail conflicts
% \item convex hull of points computable
% \end{itemize}

% \begin{description}
% \item[Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMR)] By using SVMR to represent the solutions in place of Smolyak interpolation, a by product of the representation is the identification of influential points.  It should be possible to improve the algorithm performance by updating solutions only at these influential points.
% \item[Large Model Implementation] It should prove useful to further exploit 
% the high degree of parallelism available in the algorithm.

%  Notice that even though equation errors are comparable in magnitude, the error in the decision rule is significantly smaller for the series representation solution.  The additional constraints on the equation system provided by computing conditional expectations paths and incorporating them into the solution at time $t$ leads to better solutions.
