 abstract = {This article reviews macroeconomic models with heterogeneous households. A key question for the relevance of these models concerns the degree to which markets are complete. This is because the existence of complete markets imposes restrictions on (i) how much heterogeneity matters for aggregate phenomena and (ii) the types of cross-sectional distributions that can be obtained. The degree of market incompleteness, in turn, depends on two factors: (i) the richness of insurance opportunities provided by the economic environment and (ii) the nature and magnitude of idiosyncratic risks to be insured. First, I review a broad collection of empirical evidence--from econometric tests of "full insurance," to quantitative and empirical analyses of the permanent income ("self-insurance") model that examine how it fits the facts about life cycle allocations, to studies that try to directly measure where economies place between these two benchmarks ("partial insurance"). The empirical evidence I survey reveals significant uncertainty in the profession regarding the magnitudes of idiosyncratic risks as well as whether or not these risks have increased since the 1970s. An important difficulty stems from the fact that inequality often arises from a mixture of idiosyncratic risk and fixed (or predictable) heterogeneity, making the two challenging to disentangle. I also discuss applications of incomplete markets models to trends in wealth, consumption, and earnings inequality both over the life cycle and over time, where this challenge is evident. Third, I discuss "approximate" aggregation--the finding that some incomplete markets models generate aggregate implications very similar to representative-agent models. What approximate aggregation does and does not imply is illustrated through several examples. Finally, I discuss some computational issues relevant for solving and calibrating such models and I provide a simple yet fully parallelizable global optimization algorithm that can be used to calibrate heterogeneous agent models.},

 abstract = {Macroeconomics is evolving from the study of aggregate dynamics to the study of the dynamics of the entire equilibrium distribution of allocations across individual economic actors. This article reviews the quantitative macroeconomic literature that focuses on household heterogeneity, with a special emphasis on the "standard" incomplete markets model. We organize the vast literature according to three themes that are central to understanding how inequality matters for macroeconomics. First, what are the most important sources of individual risk and cross-sectional heterogeneity? Second, what are individuals' key channels of insurance? Third, how does idiosyncratic risk interact with aggregate risk?},

  abstract={The increasing availability of micro data has led researchers to develop increasingly rich heterogeneous agent models. Solving these models involves nontrivial computational costs. The continuous-time solution method proposed by Ahn, Kaplan, Moll, Winberry, and Wolf (NBER Macroeconomics Annual 2017, volume 32) is dramatically fast, making feasible the solution of heterogeneous agent models with aggregate shocks by applying local perturbation and dimension reduction. While this computational innovation contributes enormously to expanding the research frontier, the essential reliance on the local linearization limits a class of problems researchers can investigate to the one where certainty equivalence with respect to aggregate shocks holds. This implies that it may be unsuitable for analyzing models where large aggregate shocks exist or nonlinearity matters. To resolve this issue, I propose an alternative solution method for continuous-time heterogeneous agent models with aggregate shocks by extending the Backward Induction method originally developed for discrete time models by Reiter (2010). The proposed method is nonlinear and global with respect to both idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks. I apply this method to solve a Krusell and Smith (1998) economy and evaluate its performance along two dimensions: accuracy and computation speed. I find that the proposed method is accurate even with large aggregate shocks and high curvature without surrendering computation speed (the baseline economy is solved within a few seconds). This new method is also applied to a model with recursive utility and an Overlapping Generations (OLG) model, and it is able to solve both models quickly and accurately.},

Our method extends standard linearization techniques and is designed to work in cases when inequality matters for the dynamics of macroeconomic aggregates. We present two applications that analyze a two-asset incomplete markets model parameterized to match the distribution of income, wealth, and marginal propensities to consume. First, we show that our model is consistent with two key features of aggregate consumption dynamics that are difficult to match with representative agent models: (i) the sensitivity of aggregate consumption to predictable changes in aggregate income and (ii) the relative smoothness of aggregate consumption.  Second, we extend the model to feature capital-skill complementarity and show how factor-specific productivity shocks shape dynamics of income and consumption inequality.},

This workhorse model – as well as heterogeneous agent models more generally – then boils down to a system of partial differential equations, a fact we take advantage of to make two types of contributions. First, a number of new theoretical results: (i) an analytic characterization of the consumption and saving behavior of the poor, particularly their marginal propensities to consume; (ii) a closed-form solution for the wealth distribution in a special case with two income types; (iii) a proof that there is a unique stationary equilibrium if the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is weakly greater than one; (iv) characterization of “soft” borrowing constraints. Second, we develop a simple, efficient and portable algorithm for numerically solving for equilibria in a wide class of heterogeneous agent models, including – but not limited to – the Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett model.},

  abstract={We explore business cycles in quantitative overlapping generations economies where households face earnings risk characterised by the high kurtosis seen in the data, and unemployment risk. The model economy exhibits large inter-generational differences in wealth driven by households' savings over the life-cycle. This substantially increases the inequality of wealth arising from households' response to uninsurable income risk, and reproduces much of the wealth inequality in the data. Solving for equilibrium under aggregate uncertainty, we explore the mechanics of a large recession for both aggregate consumption and investment and the distribution of households. Importantly, our incomplete markets model generates declines in aggregate quantities similar to that seen in the Great Recession. As result, it allows us to evaluate the welfare costs of a large recession in an incomplete markets model consistent with the overall aggregate business cycle. While TFP fell relatively little, in the recent recession, there was a large fall in hours worked. Consistency with these observations, in the model, requires a large, persistent increase in unemployment risk. Overall, the welfare costs of the recession vary by the share of income households derive from capital and labour. Younger workers, with relatively low levels of wealth, suffer most of the large fall in expected earnings. These welfare costs are large, given the persistence of the recession and its large impact on the earnings of finite-lived households. Uninsurable risk and wealth inequality help shape the aggregate response of the economy. Investment falls by more when households face little income risk, holds less precautionary savings, and are more responsive to changes in real interest rates.},

  abstract={What drives sharp declines in aggregate quantities over the Great Recession? I study this question by building a dynamic stochastic overlapping generations economy where households hold both low-return liquid and high-return illiquid assets. In this environment, I consider shocks to aggregate TFP that occur alongside a rise in risk of a further economic downturn. Importantly, a higher probability of an economic disaster is consistent with the recent evidence finding a decline in householdsâ€™ expected income growth over the Great Recession. I also show that a rise in disaster risk explains the rise in savings rates, seen in the micro data over the Great Recession. When calibrated to reproduce the distribution of wealth as well as the frequency and severity of disasters reported in Barro (2006), a rise in disaster risk, and an empirically consistent fall in TFP, explains around 70 percent of the decline in aggregate consumption and more than 50 percent of the decline in investment over the Great Recession. Comparing my model to an economy without illiquid assets, I find that household variation in the liquidity of wealth plays a key role in amplifying the effect of a rise in disaster risk.},

A monetary policy focused on unemployment stabilization helps \\Main Street\\\&quot; by providing consumption insurance.

On the aggregate level, household heterogeneity changes the transmission of monetary policy to consumption, but hardly to GDP.
