\title{Accuracy Assessment for Heterogeneous Agent Macroeconometric Models}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}

  \cite{RePEc:eee:dyncon:v:34:y:2010:i:1:p:4-27} highlights the importance of
  performing
  accuracy tests when solving models like \cite{krusell98} that have
 heterogeneous agents, idiosyncratic and aggregate risk,
  incomplete markets and inequality constraints.
  This paper adapts the approach described in 
  \cite{RePEc:fip:fedgfe:2018-70}
to construct error bounds for such heterogeneous agents models.
In contrast to the simulation strategy adopted
in \cite{RePEc:eee:dyncon:v:34:y:2010:i:1:p:4-27}, this paper shows how to
construct local error bounds for model variables by measuring 
the accuracy of the model solutions along
strategically generated model solution paths.  In addition,
the paper shows how to
use auxiliary variables to construct a variety of solution metrics
reflecting a wider range of researcher objectives.
